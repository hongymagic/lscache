The lscache library is a simple library that emulates memcache functions using HTML5 localStorage, so that you can store items with an expiration date.

You can play around with the demo here:

This library was originally developed with the use case of caching results of JSON API queries
to speed up my API-dependent webapps and give them better protection against flaky APIs.
It can be used for any number of uses, however.
